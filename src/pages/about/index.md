description: Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn
  about their java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
  production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
  knowledge to anyone.

I'm Carina. A twenty-something year old curious traveler, mental health advocate, and all round creative, currently based in Berlin (ask me again tomorrow, I could be somewhere else).

\
As a travel enthusiast, I collect memories and experiences. I constantly try to push myself out of my comfort zone, with a strong belief that **you don't grow when you're comfortable**.

\
In this space, I want to express the beauty and freedom of travel, nature and the 'third culture kid' lifestyle I have - hoping to share the connection we all have with each other.

With a camera in one hand, the other reaches out to invite you on this exciting journey with me!
