I'm Carina. A twenty-something year old curious traveler, mental health advocate, and all round creative, currently based in Berlin (ask me again tomorrow, I could be somewhere else).

\
As a travel enthusiast, I collect memories and experiences. I constantly try to push myself out of my comfort zone, with a strong belief that **you don't grow when you're comfortable**.

\
In this space, I want to express the beauty and freedom of travel, nature and the 'third culture kid' lifestyle I have - hoping to share the connection we all have with each other.

With a camera in one hand, the other reaches out to invite you on this exciting journey with me!
